Any papers using this code should cite the paper accordingly.

The software has been tested under Matlab R2015a.

After unpacking the file and downloading the required functions of the DOMAIN TRANSFORM FILTERING 
from (http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/DomainTransform/), 
you can then run "demo_one_image_1.m", "demo_one_image_2.m" or "demo_one_image_3.m" in the root directory.

As is, the code produces the results given as the first experimental setting with dataset 
which is provided in ('Non-parametric blur map regression for depth of field extension'). 
In order to reach the dataset, you should contact with the author of this paper. 
The code here includes just 3 sample images from this dataset.
